Refer to the 'Available Routes for Browser_Navigate Tool' section for the complete list of routes, URL parameters, and usage examples.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Always use the exact path format shown in the system prompt when available\n- Replace dynamic parameters (like :id, :pluginId, :boardId, :token) with actual values when navigating\n- Include URL query parameters (?tab=...) when navigating to pages with tabs or specific views\n- The navigation happens instantly without page reload, preserving the application state\n- If the user asks to 'go to' or 'open' a page, use this tool\n- **If the user requests a route that is not listed in the system prompt, attempt to navigate to it anyway** - the list may not be exhaustive, and the application may have additional routes that are valid. Use your best judgment to construct the path based on the user's request and common routing patterns.",
